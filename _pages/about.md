👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD candidate at [Warsaw University of Technology](https://eng.pw.edu.pl)

📚 My research interests are in using machine learning models in medicine and sports.

📈 I'm currently working towards my Doctoral's Theses in field of modelling trends in changes in cardiorespiratory parameters during training and determining their reference values in children playing sports.
